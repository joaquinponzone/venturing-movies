# Venturing
React + NodeJS

The server works interacting with a mySQL database named 'venturing-movies'. The server will need that DB locally at this stage of the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory you will find two directories. "api" for the back-end server and "client" for the browser interface. Inside each one, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) to view it in the browser. PORT wil be 3001 for the server and 3000 for the client

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
